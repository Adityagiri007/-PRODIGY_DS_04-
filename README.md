## 📊 Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Dataset

This repository contains my completed task on performing **Sentiment Analysis** using a Twitter dataset. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral.

---

### 🚀 Project Objectives

- Preprocess raw tweet data (cleaning, tokenization, removing noise).
- Visualize insights from the dataset (word clouds, class distribution, etc.).
- Train machine learning models to classify tweet sentiments.
- Evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
- **NLTK / TextBlob / Scikit-learn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

### 📈 Results

- Achieved XX% accuracy using [Model Name].
- Word clouds and sentiment distribution visualized for insight.
- Successfully classified tweets into **positive**, **negative**, and **neutral** categories.

---

### ✅ Key Learnings

- Text cleaning and preprocessing is essential in NLP tasks.
- TF-IDF and CountVectorizer are powerful for feature extraction.
- Model selection and evaluation help in identifying best-performing models for text data.

---

### 📌 To Do / Improvements

- Integrate a deep learning model (e.g., LSTM).
- Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit for a live demo.
- Add real-time Twitter scraping using Tweepy or snscrape.
